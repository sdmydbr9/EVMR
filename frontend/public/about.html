                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    At PetSphere, our mission is to transform veterinary practice management through innovative technology 
                    that empowers veterinary professionals to provide exceptional care while running efficient, 
                    profitable practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe that when veterinary professionals have the right tools, they can focus more on what matters most: 
                    the health and wellbeing of animals in their care.

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                PetSphere was founded in 2018 by a team of veterinarians and software engineers who recognized 
                the need for a modern, comprehensive practice management solution designed specifically for 
                the unique challenges of veterinary medicine.
            </p>
            <p>
                After experiencing firsthand the limitations of existing veterinary software, our founders set out 
                to create a platform that would streamline workflows, improve client communication, and provide 
                powerful insights to help practices thrive.
            </p>
            <p>
                What began as a small startup has grown into a trusted solution used by thousands of veterinary 
                professionals across the country. Throughout our growth, we've remained committed to our core values 
                of innovation, reliability, and exceptional service.
